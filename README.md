# Visitor Design Pattern

### Description 
Adding new computations inside object classes works fine if the program being developed is simple. However, when the program becomes more complex, adding new methods to the original code will make it difficult to maintain and will likely increase the chances for more error-prone code. 

The visitor pattern solves this problem. It allows for the addition of operations (methods) to object structures (classes) ***without modifying*** the existing structures themselves - resulting in less error prone code that is easier to maintain.

### Purpose
This small program was developed to help myself understand the design pattern and use it as a quick reference before I go on to implement it in future projects.
